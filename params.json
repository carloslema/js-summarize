{"name":"JS Summarize","tagline":"NLP Summarizer built with Javascript.","body":"# JS Summarize\r\nJS Summarize is a Natural Language Processing utility used to summarize large bodies of text down into a small subset of sentences.\r\n\r\nJS Summarize borrows heavily from the summarizing algorithm used in [PyTeaser](https://github.com/xiaoxu193/PyTeaser)\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nClick [here](http://wkallhof.github.io/js-summarize/example.html) for a demo\r\n\r\n## How To Use\r\nInclude the js-summarize file in your page and reference all of the necessary library items.\r\nThen:\r\n``` javascript\r\nvar summarizer = new JsSummarize();\r\nvar summary = summarizer.summarize(\"Text title here\",\"Full text here\");\r\n/*\r\n\toutput summary array:\r\n\r\n\t[\r\n\t\t\"Best summarizing sentence here.\",\r\n\t\t\"Second best summarizing sentence here.\",\r\n\t\t\"Third best summarizing article here.\",\r\n\t\t                     ...\r\n\t]\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n* Create a better tokenizer to parse out correct sentences. Right now there are a lot of problems parsing initials properly (ex. U.S.A. )\r\n* Remove dependencies on other libraries (jquery, lodash, and sugar)\r\n* Clean up and comment code\r\n* Research and re-evaluate score calculating algorithms\r\n","google":"UA-45992591-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
